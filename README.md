===============================

This game is inspired by the classic Frogger arcade game. Basically, The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies. To do so we will use the arrow keys to help our buddy get where he needs to be. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water then the game is won.
