# Arcade game Project
This game is inspired by the arcade classic Frogger and basically the objective is to get the player avatar from one side of the map to the other. It's pretty fun!

HOW IT WORKS
=============
In order to run the game you will need to open the index.html file provided in a web browser. The directional keys are used to move the player character. Once the user reaches the other side of the board the game resets. Hopefully you find it fun.
